Waste is a Thief : Welcome to my blog, "Waste is a Thief" where I will be discussing all things environmental sustainability and hopefully together we can find some excess to eliminate from our homes, travels and even works consumption.  After all waste has multiple drawbacks in terms of excessive costs, emissions and in the worse cases actually leads to reduced performance.
