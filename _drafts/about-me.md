# A little about the caller

I have been in software engineering for as long as I can remember and for my sins that has been exercised in the financial services sector since I left university in 2006.  More recently, since Jan 2018, I have been working with the startup challenger clearing bank ClearBank where running lean has always been the ethos and this doubled down since becoming profitable.  For just over a year now I have been leading the environmental sustainability team which was a natural progression from being the platform principal engineer and an evangelist of the Well-Architected Framework the pillar of which include reliability, security, cost optimisation, operational excellence, performance efficiency and sustainability.

I have a young family and after lockdown we moved out of Islington in central London to the Deal on the Kent coastline where I was able to put software engineering, architectural approaches, experimentation to practise on decarbonising the home and travel environment as much as possible.

So I expect this blog will be a mix of personal insights and bringing together the good as well as the bad news I find on all things energy generation / transportation, emissions accounting, home decarbonisation, sustainable software products and anything else in this space I find myself thinking over.
