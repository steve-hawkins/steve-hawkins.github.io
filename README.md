# Waste is a Thief blog

My findings and thoughts on the sustainability of software products.

## Development

There is a .devcontainer and I recommend using GitHub codespaces.

Once in vscode make changes and exec `bundle exec jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` or `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --future` to deploy the site locally for review before pushing.

> [!TIP]
> `bundle install` is still required until I get it working in the .devcontainer...
