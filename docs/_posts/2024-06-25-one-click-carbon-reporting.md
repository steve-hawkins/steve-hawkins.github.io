## easier and more accurate reporting

I have had the recent opportunity to meet the great people of Icebreaker One project [Perseus](https://icebreakerone.org/perseus/) who are looking to make SME carbon reporting more accurate and as easy as a click of a button.  I am looking forward to getting more involved as part of the technical advisory board.

I could try and write in more detail about the intent of Project Perseus, but they have spent the time and effort on this fantastic video:
