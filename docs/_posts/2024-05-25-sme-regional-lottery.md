## carbon reporting needs equity not equality

According to [The Carbon Trust](https://www.watermagazine.co.uk/2023/07/27/uk-smes-emit-nearly-15m-tonnes-of-co2-a-year-yet-77-have-no-plans-to-reduce-carbon-footprint-over-next-three-years/) around 44% of the UK carbon emissions are currently from small to medium enterprises.  However, the average SME produces around 15 mtCO2e annually with a few factors that can greatly impact this number like sector, location, size and how efficient the SME is with the energy they consume.

Today I will be discussing the location factor and how this is a bit of a lottery for SME emissions.  First we need a little bit of knowledge about one of the biggest regional differentiators in terms of SME emissions, the electricity grid energy generation mix.

There are 14 different "regions" across Great Britain that can have a very different gCO2e (grams of carbon dioxide equivalent) per kWh (kilowatt hour) of electricity consumed at different times of the day.  I find [Carbon Intensity UK](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/) to be the most reliable source of information and data on this subject.

So how does this impact SME carbon emissions reporting?  It means that an SME in say the North of Scotland will typically have much lower electricity energy consumption emissions than an SME in the South West of England.  At the time of writing this it was:

![South West England grid emissions]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2024-05-25-152824-south-west-england.png)

This difference is due to many factors, but put simply the electricity generation, transmission and storage is more or less carbon intense.

There is talk about SMEs using a national blended rate for gCO2e.  I believe it is correct to report these numbers for the SME based on their actual regions gCO2e otherwise we lose the motivation to make localised improvements.  When it comes to things like transition funding we can then make sure it is spent on the right things for the right people in the right places.  Equity to give everyone what they actually need to make a difference rather than equality and potentially water down action.

So what can the government, SMEs and individuals do about levelling the playing field?

Encourage the development of more localised renewal energy generation, grid infrastructure and energy storage systems.

Local councils have too much power and with very few votes are able to block legitimate, sensibly planned and safe solutions.

This has to change and education is required to highlight how much they are costing and harming their local businesses and people.

### easier and more accurate reporting

I have had the recent opportunity to meet the great people of Icebreaker One project [Perseus](https://icebreakerone.org/perseus/) who are looking to make SME carbon reporting more accurate and as easy as a click of a button.  I am looking forward to getting more involved as part of the technical advisory board.

I could try and write in more detail about the intent of Project Perseus, but they have spent the time and effort on this fantastic video:
