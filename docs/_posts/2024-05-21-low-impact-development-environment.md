## Part 1 - Software Engineers Devices

It wouldn't be polite for me to write this blog about sustainable software products and share it with the world on a solution that had a high impact on the environment now would it.

So I am going to write a series of posts about my investigations into the causes of emissions from software and some of the solutions I have trialled whilst creating this blog.

Let us start the journey by talking about the software engineers device itself.  Commonly this has been a high-powered usually heavily gaming inspired full tower desktop, quite often with parts like CPU and GPU being upgraded on a regular cadence which in turn requires the other components like motherboard, cooling, PSU, etc to be upgraded as well...

To compound this e-waste issue there is also an unexpectedly large carbon footprint in the [creation and transportation](https://circularcomputing.com/news/carbon-footprint-laptop/) of these goods.

So what is the solution?  Reduce waste, only use what is necessary to do the job well, that's it, nothing else, anything else is excessive...

Now this is just a simple blog, but I want to see how far I can take a few of these concepts into bigger and more complex software products.
