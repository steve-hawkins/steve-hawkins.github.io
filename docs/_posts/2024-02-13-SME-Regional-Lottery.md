# Welcome

According to (cite) over 50% of the UK carbon emissions are currently from small to medium enterprises.  However, the average SME produces around 15 mtCO2e annually with a few factors that can greatly impact this number like sector, location, size and how efficient the SME is with the energy they consume.  Today I will be discussing the location factor and how this is a bit of a lottery on SME emissions.

I have had the recent opportunity to meet the great people of ice breaker one project Perseus and hope to get more involved as part of the technical advisory board.  I could try and write about what the intent of Project Perseus is, but they have spent the time and effort on a fantastic video.
