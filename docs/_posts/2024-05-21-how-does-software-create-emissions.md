## Emissions from software

There are a number of factors that contribute to how much impact software products have on the environment.  We have to consider how the software is developed and maintained, where it is hosted, how where and even when it is consumed.

In general the main cause of emissions from software products is by the resources developing, hosting and consuming them, whether via the hardware goods creation, transportation, maintenance and disposal or the energy they consume whilst in use.

For something like a website, take this blog, then it was developed on a software engineers device, the code stored somewhere, the application built and then published to hosting servers, network devices routing requests and serving pages to user devices.  There are actually quite a lot of hops, physical devices and energy being consumed whilst serving up an innocent looking webpage...  Fear not, as you read this blog you will get insights into how I am trying to make it as low impact as possible whilst increasing awareness.  You can even see the estimated carbon emissions as you view my blog on each page in the footer thanks to the [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/).

I found a great set of resources from the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/) including the Linux Foundation certification course [Green Software Practitioner](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/) that I highly recommend and would encourage anyone involved in software products to take.

I wanted to get the ball rolling on this blog, so this post is a little light on details, but I will make sure I go into more depth on areas of software emissions and how we can tackle them in further posts.
