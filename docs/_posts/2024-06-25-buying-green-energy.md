## what are green energy instruments?

There is a whole other article required to go into how companies are purchasing green energy via different instruments such as [REGOs](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-and-social-schemes/renewable-energy-guarantees-origin-rego) (Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin), but these have the same issues of blended ratings not including the reality or lacking detail of region and time.

The [GHG Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/) (Greenhouse Gas Protocol) has some great, but heavy reading on this in their [Scope 2 Guidance](https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/Scope%202%20Guidance.pdf).
